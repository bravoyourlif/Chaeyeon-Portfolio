Introduction 
==========================
Hello! I am currently a Ph.D. Student at School of City and Regional Planning, Georgia Tech. I'm interested in analyzing and visualizing urban issues through computer science. I hope to contribute to building a sustainable, resilient, equitable and exciting(!) city. I work at the Center for Spatial Planning Analysis and Visualization at Georgia Tech. 

Apart from my academic interest, I love Korean indie music, ballet, tennis, coffee, and cooking then eating!  
I am an active member of the Korean Youth Climate Change Network, BIGWAVE. I engage in the researcher network and participate in climate change related studies in the group.
