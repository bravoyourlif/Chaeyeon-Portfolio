Introduction 
==========================
I am currently a second year master student at Department of Urban and Regional Planning, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My interest revolves in analyzing and solving convoluted urban issues through computer science. I hope to contribute to building a sustainable, resilient, equitable and exciting(!) city through urban studies and technology. I am working with the CyberGIS center, which is a research center in the GGIS (Geography and Geographical Information Science) department at UIUC. My main role is to develop deep learning models to forecast pandemic risk using mobility data.    

Apart from my academic interest, I love Korean indie music, ballet, tennis, coffee, and cooking then eating!  
I am an active member of the Korean Youth Climate Change Network, BIGWAVE. I engage in the researcher network and participate in climate change related studies in the group. I am also working as a graduate team staff in Korean Student Association (KSA) at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois.
