Introduction 
==========================
I am currently studying urban planning at UIUC. I have a background in computer science and engineering. My interest revolves in analyzing and solving convoluted urban issues through data science. I hope to contribute to building sustainable and equitable city through transdisciplinary studies in urban planning and data science. Apart from my academic interest, I love Korean indie music, ballet, coffee, and cooking then eating!  

I am an active member of the Korean Youth Climate Change Network, BIGWAVE. I engage in the researcher network and participate in climate change related studies in the group. I am also working as a graduate team staff in Korean Student Association (KSA) at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois.
